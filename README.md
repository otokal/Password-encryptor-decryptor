# Password-encryptor-decryptor

I created a password encyptor and decrytor for fun.
If you ever needed one, be my guest. It encrypts you password and generates secret key. In the decrypt window you can decrypt the password with your secret key and encrypted password. You can create your own secret key and use one key to encrypt dozens of passwords.
